# 🌐 Resume Website (HTML & CSS)

This is a **simple resume-style website** created using **HTML and CSS**.  
I built this project while learning CSS fundamentals such as layout, colors, spacing, and card-based design.

The goal of this project is to practice **frontend basics** and understand how real websites are structured.
